# Booking Data Visualization

## Overview
This repository contains a Python project developed as part of a university assignment for the course *Principles of Programming Languages & Translators* at the Department of Computer Engineering & Informatics, University of Patras. The project analyzes and a dataset of hotel bookings and provides various statistical insights and visualizations in a user-friendly grafical user interface.

## Project Details
The project uses the "Hotel Booking" dataset, which contains 119,390 records of bookings between July 1, 2015, and August 31, 2017. The dataset includes information such as booking dates, room types, number of guests, and cancellations. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking).

For more details on the workings of the application please read the Report.png (In Greek).

### Features:
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate key statistics such as average length of stay and cancellation rates.
- **Booking Distribution**: Analyze bookings by month, season, and room type.
- **Guest Segmentation**: Categorize bookings into families, couples, or solo travelers.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Explore booking trends over time and detect seasonality in bookings and cancellations.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate various plots and graphs to visualize the results.
